            <p>Hello World! I'm Laura, a 29 year old mixed Mediterrean German human being based in Berlin. 
                After having done a Bachelor of Arts in Cultural Science and Philosophy during which I have gained
            work experience as a Receptionist in one of Berlin's best rated Hostels, I have continued a Career in Tourism
            working as an Office Manager for a Bike Rental & Bike Tour Operator. <br> <br>
            Since always however I've had a thing for logical
            thinking and Technology which led me to start volunteering in autumn 2020 as a "technical coach" for the Elderly.
            As I seem to have an enjoyable personality and have been doing good work, I have been proposed to lead a Windows Beginner Course
        for the Elderly which I have gladly accepted and doing at the moment.
    <br><br>
<em>So.. when and how did Programming come into my Life? </em> I have had the dormant plan for years which I started putting into practice
        after breaking my fibula and being constricted to not move for 6 weeks. With this perspective I instantly started an online Career Path to become a <em>Full-Stack Developer</em> by
    the wonderful e-Learning platform CodeCademy and have been loving the challenge!  </p>
